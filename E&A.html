<h1>What we Learned</h1><br>
<h2>We learned how to <em>1st program,2nd design and 3rd build.</em><br>
3 Programing can be tuff believe me but if you try you can do it.We could not code at first<br>
but then we started to get the hang of it and started to make less mistakes until<br>
eventually we got it perfect. We would say practise or research it and then show your<br>
class.
