<h1>What we Learned</h1><br>
<h2>We learned how to <em>.</em><br>1st design 2nd build 3rd program
2 building was easy for us but only because we were used to lego we are 10 year olds. But if you,re not used to  it thats fine
3 Programing can be tuff believe me but if you try you can do it.We could not code at first<br>
but then we started to get the hang of it and started to make less mistakes until<br>
eventually we got it perfect.we yoused robot c alot like scratch and makes it easier for use but use whatever suits. We would say <br> 
practise or research it and then show your class.
